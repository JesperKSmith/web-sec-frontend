# WebSecurityProjectFrontend

This project is the frontend part of a project that demonstrates security concepts taught in a Web Security elective.

The application idea is in a general sense inspired by facebook, in the way that it allows for user creation, and users can communicate through creating posts, as well as leaving comments on posts.
